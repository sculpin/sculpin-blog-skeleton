Sculpin Blog Skeleton
=====================

A skeleton for a Sculpin based blog.

Powered by [Sculpin](http://sculpin.io). =)


Features
--------

A very basic Sculpin based blog supporting the following features:

 * Very minimal Bootstrap based theme.
 * A handful of existing posts in `source/_posts/` to get you started. Feel
   free to remove these when you are ready.
 * An about page at `/about`.
 * An index page at `/`. It displays all posts and paginates them.
 * A blog archive page at `/blog`. It displays post titles broken down by
   month and is paginated.
 * A blog categories page at `/blog/categories`.
 * A blog category index at `/blog/categories/$category`. Similar to the blog
   archive except broken down by each category.
 * A blog tags page at `/blog/tags`.
 * A blog tag index at `/blog/tags/$tag`. Similar to the blog archive
   except broken down by each tag.

Prerequisites
-------------

Sculpin is a PHP application and installed with the PHP package manager `composer`.
See https://getcomposer.org/ for installation instructions.

Unless you do a very basic website, you want some CSS and Javascript assets. Sculpin
uses `yarn` to manage them. See https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install for installation
instructions.

Install
-------

Create a new project using composer:

```bash
$ composer create-project sculpin/blog-skeleton my-blog
```

This application uses [Symfony's Webpack Encore](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend.html)
to manage CSS, JavaScript and image assets. Install the JS dependencies:

```bash
$ cd my-blog
$ yarn install
```

Build
-----

First, start Encore to compile and update the assets in `source/assets/` into
`source/build/`. The watcher keeps running until you exit it manually:

```bash
$ composer yarn-watch
```

In a new console, start the sculpin watcher to have your content updated as
soon as you save changes:

```bash
$ composer sculpin-watch
```

Your newly generated clone of sculpin-blog-skeleton should now be accessible
at `http://localhost:8000/`.

Documentation
-------------

The skeleton provides you with useful configuration and some example data for
a Sculpin installation.
